## 🎵 SONG LYRICS WITH TIMESTAMPS

### **[INTRO - 0:00-0:12]**
*Electronic jingle bells, building anticipation*

**Spoken intro (with echo effect):**
> "Ziemassvētki tuvojas... bet uzmanies... Grinčs ir tiešsaistē!"
> 
> *(Christmas is coming... but beware... the Grinch is online!)*

---

### **[VERSE 1 - 0:12-0:32]** 
*Genre: Upbeat Pop with electronic sleigh bells*

```
Sniegs klāj jumtus, eglīte spīd,                    (Snow covers roofs, the tree shines bright,)
Bet Grinčs datorā slēpjas un grīd.                  (But Grinch hides in computers, grinding with spite.)
Viņš sūta e-pastus: "Tu uzvarēji prīzi!"           (He sends emails: "You won a prize!")
Nespied uz linkiem — tas ir viņa vīzi!              (Don't click the links — that's his disguise!)

Pikšķerēšana* ir viņa spēle,                        (Phishing is his favorite game,)
Tavi dati — viņa Ziemassvētku mērķis un cēle.      (Your data — his Christmas aim and claim.)
```

*\*Pikšķerēšana = Phishing (Latvianized)*

**🔐 Cybersecurity Lesson:** Phishing awareness — don't click suspicious links or "prize" emails

---

### **[CHORUS - 0:32-0:52]**
*Genre: Folk-inspired, singalong style with accordion undertones*

```
Kiberdrošība Ziemassvētkos — sargā sevi, draugs!   (Cybersecurity at Christmas — protect yourself, friend!)
Stipras paroles, divpakāpju — un Grinčs būs traks! (Strong passwords, two-factor — and Grinch goes mad!)
Nespied, nepērc, nepadalies ar svešiem!            (Don't click, don't buy, don't share with strangers!)
Lai ir droši Ziemassvētki — ne ar hakeriem mežiem! (Let Christmas be safe — not wild with hackers!)
```

**🔐 Cybersecurity Lessons:** Strong passwords, 2FA, safe browsing habits

---

### **[VERSE 2 - 0:52-1:12]**
*Genre: Synth-pop with playful melody*

```
Grinčs uz WiFi publisku pieslēdzas kluss,          (Grinch quietly connects to public WiFi,)
Lasa tavus datus — viņš nav nekāds mīlus!          (Reads your data — he's not sweet, oh my!)
Izmanto VPN, kad kafejnīcā sēdi,                   (Use a VPN when sitting at the café,)
Citādi Grinčs zin, ko tu Ziemassvētkos ēdi!        (Otherwise Grinch knows what you ate Christmas Day!)

Viņš zog kredītkartes un paroles vecas,            (He steals credit cards and old passwords too,)
Atjaunini drošību — vai būsi viņa upuris tu!      (Update your security — or the victim is you!)
```

**🔐 Cybersecurity Lessons:** VPN on public WiFi, updating passwords, financial security

---

### **[RAP BRIDGE - 1:12-1:32]**
*Genre: Festive Rap with trap beats and sleigh bells*

```
(Rap — fast-paced delivery)

Yo, Grinčs domā, ka viņš ir boss,                  (Yo, Grinch thinks he's the boss,)
Bet mēs zinām — viņš ir cyber-loss!                (But we know — he's a cyber-loss!)
Parole "123456"? Tas ir joks!                      (Password "123456"? That's a joke!)
Lieto simbolus, ciparus — dari to kā proks!        (Use symbols, numbers — do it like a pro!)

Divpakāpju autentifikācija — tas ir must,          (Two-factor authentication — that's a must,)
Grinčs mēģina ielauzties — bet viņš ir dust!      (Grinch tries to break in — but he's dust!)
Atjaunini programmas, neizmanto veco,              (Update your software, don't use the old,)
Citādi tavi dati ir Grinča zelto!                  (Otherwise your data is Grinch's gold!)
```

**🔐 Cybersecurity Lessons:** Strong password complexity, 2FA, software updates

---

### **[FINAL CHORUS - 1:32-1:50]**
*Genre: Full band — Folk/Pop/Electronic fusion, triumphant feel*

```
Kiberdrošība Ziemassvētkos — sargā sevi, draugs!   (Cybersecurity at Christmas — protect yourself, friend!)
Stipras paroles, divpakāpju — un Grinčs būs traks! (Strong passwords, two-factor — and Grinch goes mad!)
Nespied, nepērc, nepadalies ar svešiem!            (Don't click, don't buy, don't share with strangers!)
Lai ir droši Ziemassvētki — ne ar hakeriem mežiem! (Let Christmas be safe — not wild with hackers!)
```

---

### **[OUTRO - 1:50-1:55]**
*Fade out with jingle bells*

**Spoken (Grinch voice, defeated):**
> "Nākamgad... nākamgad es jūs dabūšu!"
> 
> *(Next year... next year I'll get you!)*

**Hero response (triumphant):**
> "Ne, ja mēs būsim kiberdrošībā gudri! Priecīgus Ziemassvētkus!"
> 
> *(Not if we stay cyber-smart! Merry Christmas!)*
